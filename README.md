Brainstorming:
	CHUNITHM inspired keyboard rhythm game (possibly with inspiration from O.N.G.E.K.I)
	
	Gameplay: Notes come towards the screen and you press the key(s) on the row that correspond to it. (too many/10K)
		In addition, notes can come at the air, where you have to press keys on a column above the key
		Lastly, you (may be able to) move your character with left/right alt and jump with spacebar.
